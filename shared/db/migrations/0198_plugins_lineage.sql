-- Slot 0198 - plugins: the lineage a plugin's write leaves on its subject (Epic 54,
-- story 54.40 §3).
--
--   plugin_write_lineage  for each subject a plugin wrote (a tag, a field, chapters,
--                         subtitles, artwork), the writing job's lineage (its origin, hop
--                         count and path of (plugin stage, subject) pairs) and when. A
--                         plugin job a core event starts on that subject within 10 minutes
--                         inherits it, so a loop through data (a write that reruns a core
--                         stage whose event starts the writer again) is refused as
--                         plugin_loop instead of running for ever. One row per subject: the
--                         newest write wins.
--
-- As slot 0194's tables: the default grants, plugin_tables_guard() refuses writes by a
-- joined machine (maktaba_worker), and a machine's copy leaves it out
-- (cluster_copy_excluded() is slot 0197's list and this one). Additive.
